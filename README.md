# Overview
[Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)](https://www.isc2.org/certified-in-cybersecurity) is an entry-level security certification by (ISC)². Research from (ISC)² and others continues to conclude that there is a global shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals. While there are many contributing factors, (ISC)² believes one solution is to create a certification that enables candidates – including students, young professionals and career-changers – to demonstrate to employers their familiarity with foundational cybersecurity concepts as determined by cybersecurity professionals and practitioners already in the field.
